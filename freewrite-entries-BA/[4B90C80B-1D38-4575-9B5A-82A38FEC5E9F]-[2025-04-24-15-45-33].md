how to work yourself out of a funk.

honestly. 
it’s dark place and the world is out to get you. 

yeah, if you believe this thought, then things are gonna be bad for you. 

from this point forward I am committing to a life full of love. 
I’m committing to finding smiles. joy. happiness. patience. 
respect. fulfillment. peace. 

it’s not that I wasn’t committed to that life before, but if I’m being honest with myself. 

this is one building block at a time. 
and there’s some kind of commitment that I ought to show up for. 

priming my mind for what I want to see more of. 
literally priming your RAS for what you want to see more of. 

i want more community.
I’ going to find it. 
if you tell yourself it’s a lonely world, then you’re not going to do what you need to do to find others that resonate with you. 

I like starstride because it is a movement. 
it’s a brand. 
it’s something to represent. 

cultivate. 
innovate. 
elevate. 

so look, a great community is upheld by client relations. 
I can see me leading a community called starstride. 

i don’t know who it would consist of. 
but the values are cultivation, innovation, and elevation.v
