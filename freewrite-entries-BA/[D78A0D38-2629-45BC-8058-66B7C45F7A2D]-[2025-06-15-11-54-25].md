okay freewrite. 

we’re doing this. it’s time to lock in. i feel clarity and peace, more so than I’ve felt in a while. i have somewhat of a financial concern but it’s okay because I have faith it will get worked out. 

recently been all about balance. love, good energy good vibes peace trading excersize diet content

past few months i was letting go of the identity of business guru persona and it has allowed me to open space back up for my most authentic self

seems like the way this is evolving is that Im an artist first and foremost and my essence is bold / sexy, entertaining and funny unhinged bold artist very confident and high self esteem 

i have entrepreneurial interests but the immediate mission is mostly to leverage my business capacity to scale my own brand 

so right now the game plan is to leverage ai to build out infrastructure than will same me more time and energy

n8n seems to be something that I’ll be able to use
not even sure to what capcity yet 
as when I first dove in I thought about creating an online ai agency but now I’m thinking let’s use this to buikld my own brand and scale so that my emotional runway doesn’t get spent and I don’t get distracted from the overall mission

I can learn how to use n8n to build agents practically and usefully for my own mission

this way I won’t be doing it as a means to an end and once I have infrastructure in place I can basically manage my career as an independent artist or creator until I get picked up by a label or something

I think that might be my longterm intention but we’ll just have to see as we build shit out

I am gradually developing a content system and figuring out how I can show up in a unique way in the most authentic way possible

it’s coming together
the season of life has been very open and releasing of things that are out of alignment

alignment is key and everything to me right now. 

so the immediate game plan is to build an updated bronsonai 
I’ll ask it to ask me questions and answer them in voice memos
transcribe it and upload it as context so I have a partner in crime that speaks my language. 

additionally we’ll begin building ai agents that can be implemented somewhow (tbh i don’t even know) but we’ll learn how to build ai agents that can be leveraged and we’ll learn how to leverage them

i thought maybe I needed a team but honestly my agents and systems can be the team

whatever a dumb artist could seek to delegate but not have enough money for, I can build it out myself ideally using n8n

aside from that the next 20 days are gonna be hella crazy
lot of moving around and travel and shows 
which is good because it amps up the stakes and the stress 
and I feel a bit more locked in

like I was made to hold more responsibility and this past season has been all about being open and surrenduring parts of myself that I’m not aligned with at a soul level and now that there has been space, new parts of myself have fallen into place whether conscious or not and it’s time to tighten and close identity a little bit more so I can more with more purpose, intention, direction and conviction

honing in on a clear big ass goal that can be attained with clear systematic steps and an implementation of work ethic and discipline

i’m excited and refreshed
